Platform: @DJDevon3's TR=COWBELL with Raspberry Pi PicoW

IDE: mu-editor

NOTE: After adding code to receive ntp datetime and set builtin RTC
      and after adding functions glob_flag_change(), dt_update() and pr_dt() and changing other parts to call the new functions.

REPL output:     (Note: my_debug flag = False)



soft reboot

Auto-reload is on. Simply save files over USB to run them or enter REPL to disable.
